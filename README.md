## AR with Aruco markers
Marker-based Augmented Reality, also known as image recognition AR, uses an object or a fiducial marker as a reference to determine the position or orientation of the camera. 

Maker-based AR works by scanning a marker like an Aruco marker. The Auroc marker detection triggers an augmented experience to position an object, text, video, or animation to appear on the device. 

### In this example, we will write a simple code to augment an image on a video with Aurco markers.
